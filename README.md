# Welcome to BOARD HORDE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) and [React-Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation).

## Let's Get It Going
*Clone both backend and frontend repos

Once the [backend Rails framework](https://github.com/bolloland/board-backend) is running,\
in the project directory, you can run:
## `npm install`
## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.\
(if it hasn't already done so.)

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
